This a combination of flappy bird and pong that I thought would make a neat little game, so I gave it my best shot. 
Made using p5.js and sublime and then copied over to the web editor for a playable demo! Enjoy!

## How to Play: 
Space or left click to jump 

Try to bounce the puck off of the paddles 

Speed increases at set intervals 

## Good luck!
